# *This is my  react todo-list app which I have designed to help manage daily tasks.


**Hello in this react.js markdown you can see the steps that the code takes to produce the todo list.**

--The code in TodoForm.js handles the logic for changes, submissions and inputs for this app.



--The code in Todo.js hanles the logic for edits, removals and updates.

...

--Then the app.css creates the lovely colors that make it easier navigation.

...

--This react app is currently being hosted on github at:  <https://1tracyk.github.io/todo-list-react>

...

--Then the TodoList.js component will filter through the code in Todo.js using hooks, map and filter to set new todos.






 Thank You,
